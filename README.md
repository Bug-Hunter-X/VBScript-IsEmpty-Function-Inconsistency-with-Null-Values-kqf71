This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript's `IsEmpty` function when dealing with null or uninitialized variables passed as function arguments. The `IsEmpty` function does not consistently differentiate between an empty string and a null value, potentially leading to runtime errors. The provided solution shows a more robust way to check for both null and empty string values in VBScript functions.
